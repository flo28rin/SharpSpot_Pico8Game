Tower Defense Game by Florin

A small tower defense game in which you try to survive for as long as possible, making the last stand agains the invading enemies. Protect your last priced possesions on planet Eahrat and kill as many of the ivading Juniperian forces, who are carrying a very contagious disease that turn sentient beings into mad men.

The game has two modes - mode A and mode B. Mode A starts a little slower, and builds up to mode B after 50 kills. Mode B adds a twist to tower defense games, where enemies go off the path and the game becomes a mayhem for getting the biggest score. You can select the mode you want to play in the main menu.

The game currently has 1 type of enemy, that comes in 1 wave. The spawned enemies get more speed as time goes on. If an enemy reaches the end, or if it hits the player, the player will lose health.

There is one available turret with 8 upgrades. The bullets are smart and will stop mid air until detecting new enemy, another new mechanic that can change tower defense gameplay style.

In the menu, you can us up/down arrows and X to select

In the game, you can move with arrow keys and use X to place or upgrade turrents.
